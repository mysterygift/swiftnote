# Data Transfer

Data transfer between a server and a client is typically passed via JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

```json
{
    "author" : "Aran Davies",
    "nickname" : "mysterygift_",
    "passtime" : "weeping into vsc"
}
```

Essentially, the client's job is to parse the JSONs received by the server and then displaying it/mutating it in a way that looks great and is intuitive.

I'll make more notes on networking later on as it's not super fun.
