# Dependencies

Third-party libraries of code written by other developers that we can take advantage of to make things easier for us. Examples of these include Hero, which has customer iOS view controller transitions, or libraries that make creating charts easier.

Libraries can be installed with a number of package managers – Swift Package Manager is Apple's first-party Swift dependency manager.

# Downsides

The rule of thumb is that libraries should be used sparingly, as you're depending on other developers maintaining their code and can often end up importing a lot of bloat into your projects that just isn't being used.
